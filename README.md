# Guerrilla Science Application 2018

This repository contains the application for Guerrilla Science ArtSci Residency 2018, by Sof√≠a Suazo & Guillermo Montecinos.<br>
*February 2018.*<br>

You can check our application in the following [link](https://github.com/guillemontecinos/guerrilla_science_application_2018/blob/master/application.md).

## Max/Msp patch
For this project, a [software](https://github.com/guillemontecinos/guerrilla_science_application_2018/tree/master/max_patch) was developed in Max/Msp. The algorithm works measuring the average pixel value for the three RGB channels of the computer webcam. Those values are saturated by comparing with a threshole and the result if this operation is used as input of a sin wave ocillator or a midi note generator that can be used for trigger an external instrument.<br>

A sample video of the algorithm can be found in the following [link]().
